Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning

A simple Linear Regression project that predicts student marks based on the number of courses taken and study time.  
Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features
- Predicts marks based on study time and courses  
- Visualizes correlations and predictions  
- Evaluates model performance (MSE, R²)  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to run locally  


 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### 6️⃣ **Usage / How It Works**
Explain briefly how to use it — input → output.
```markdown
## 🧩 Usage
The model takes two inputs:
- **number_courses** → Number of courses taken  
- **time_study** → Study time in hours  

It predicts the **Marks** using a trained Linear Regression model.
